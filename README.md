# HTML_CSS_JS-project-UDEMY

Part of the Udemy Course Building 50 quick, unique & fun mini projects with HTML, CSS and JS.

This has been an awesome course. I took this course so that I can build some random components each day to practice my coding skills, however, this course has helped me not only do that but I learned a lot of ne things which I did not initially know. I also build some awesome projects which were very fun to build. Great course, would highly recommend to anyone trying to improve their skills or just have fun!
