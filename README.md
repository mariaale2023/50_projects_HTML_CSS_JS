# HTML_CSS_JS-project-UDEMY

Welcome to my repository, part of the Udemy Course Building 50 quick, unique & fun mini projects with HTML, CSS and JS, where you will find 50 exciting and unique projects built with JS, HTML and CSS! I will be creating one project every day throughout the year 2023, but with a little twist to add my own style and flair.

This course has been an absolute blast! My original intention was to build random components daily to improve my coding skills, but it ended up being so much more. I learned countless new things and had a ton of fun building some truly awesome projects. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to enhance their coding abilities or simply have a good time!
